### Less than a fortnight after my post on competing with identically named people, I ran into another Ben Brooks!

A strange turn of events, but here's Ben Brooks (me, right) and other Ben Brooks ([@benga](http://twitter.com/benga), left) at [ShropGeek Revloution](http://2013.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk)'s after party. Awesome.

### PS: You may have an awesome beard, but I totally ninja'd [benbrooks.co.uk](http://benbrooks.co.uk)

*Unlucky.* ;)
